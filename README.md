# Blog

I've been meaning to set up a blog for some time both for testing purposes and for detailing some of my own personal projects in the open. This repo contains the hugo, docker, and other infrastructure configurations that are necessary for setting up the desired blog. Currently, i'm planning to publish this blog as a Digital Ocean app, eventually planning to run it on kubernetes locally and in the cloud in the near future. Eventually i'll do some additional documentation here on how things fit together, but refer to the [first blog post for now](https://smerc.dev/posts/22/04/blog-explanation/)!
